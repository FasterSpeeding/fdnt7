## 🌱 Current Needed Help

- **Cosplaying Funds**: I've always really loved the craft of cosplaying, but I've never done it myself. So I wanted to try it for the first time by getting my hands on a premade cosplay clothing, and then I can be more familiar with the craft.
  
  It also feels very gender-affirming<sup>[2](2-%EF%B8%8F-regarding-me-and-coming-out)</sup> for me to wear traditionally feminine clothing! Please consider donating to me via the links [below](#-support-me)!

### <sup>1</sup>🪪 Regarding my name(s)

<details>
  <summary>👁️ View</summary>

### Etymology

> ***Fridenity*** is derived from the word "Friday" and "Nighty". Friday nights are my preferred time to relax and continue working on my passion projects. It is my favourite peroid of time in a week. *This is my brand name*.
>
> ***Fridella*** is further derived from *Fridenity*, with it being a more people name-like variation. *This is my personal name*.

### Pronouncations

> **Fri·del·la**: **`/fɹaɪˈdɛlˌlə/`** ("fri" in *Fri*day + *della*, emphasis on *del-*)
>
> **Fri·de·ni·ty**: **`/fɹaɪˈdɛn.ɪ.ti/`** (Similar to "Fidelity", adding *r* to *fi-* and replacing *li-* with *ni-*)

- Some other pronunciations that other people have called me include: *Fridella*: *`/fɹiːˈdɛˌja/`* (*free-day-ya*)

### Variations

- You are free to change the capitalization of any of these names.

> **Fridel**: shortened from *Fridella*, but the emphasis is on *fri-* instead
>
> **Fride**: pronounced exactly like "Friday"
>
> **Fifi**: pronounced "Fee-Fee", emphasis on the first *fi*. This variation is to provide the smoothest social transitioning from my deadname for whom I've already known pre-transitioned. *Read more about my transitioning in [the section below.](2-%EF%B8%8F-regarding-me-and-coming-out)*
>
> **`fdnt`**: pronounced letter by letter
>
> **`fd`**: pronounced letter by letter

### Others

> Some other names that other people have called me include: *Fridge*, *Frid*, *Fries*, *Frilly* and etc. I do find these somewhat funny, and you are also free to use them. *If you can come up with other nicknames, you can use that while talking to me as well if you see fit*; I will add your variation to this list as well if I like it.

### Old Name / Deadname

  <details>
    <summary>❗ Reveal spoiler</summary>

> My old online username was ***Teammìe***. It is a variation of my birth nickname. In the LGBTQIA+ community, this is so-called a [**Deadname**](https://gender.fandom.com/wiki/Deadnaming). This is to *separate my life before and after transitioning*<sup>[2](2-%EF%B8%8F-regarding-me-and-coming-out)</sup>, as a sort of identifier/marker.
>
> <ins>**This is a name that I do not go by anymore. I do not want to be called by this name in any circumstances unless I bring it up on my own accord first.**</ins>

### <sup>2</sup>🏳️‍🌈 Regarding me and coming out

<details>
  <summary>👁️ View</summary>

### Gender

> I was [assigned male at birth](https://gender.fandom.com/wiki/Assigned_Sex). Ever since November 2022, I've socially transitioned. I've come out as **[Non-binary](https://gender.fandom.com/wiki/Non-binary)**; more specifically, **[Demigirl](https://gender.fandom.com/wiki/Demigirl)**. To keep it brief, I do not identify as either a man or a woman, but I do feel a lot more feminine than masculine.
>
> I go by the pronouns **She/They**, as stated in the github profile's pronoun section.
>
> I am fine with being called a *girl*, a *woman* or anything along the same line, and I am also fine with being called a *Non-binary* or an *Enby*. Words like *Guy*, *Man*, *Dude* and *Bro* I all personally find to be gender-neutral, and can also be used on me. However, I do take offense to being called a *male*.

### Sexuality

> My sexuality is still **[Bisexual](https://sexuality.fandom.com/wiki/Bisexuality)** with a **preference for women**. So after my transition, I am no longer mildly [Heterosexual](https://sexuality.fandom.com/wiki/Heterosexuality) and am now mildly [Homosexual](https://sexuality.fandom.com/wiki/Homosexuality).

### Romantic Orientation

> I only find **women** to be of romantic interest. So after my transition, I am no longer [Heteromantic](https://sexuality.fandom.com/wiki/Heteromantic) and am now **[Homoromantic](https://sexuality.fandom.com/wiki/Homoromantic)**

### New Name

> I have chosen myself a new name upon my transitioning. **Read about the change and details of it in [the section above](1-regarding-my-names)**.
